frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================
This project involves one player facing 5 enemies as player crosses the road to get to water. This game has simple functionality of pressed arrow keys up, down, left, right. it also includes a reset button to restart the game. 




In order for me to complete the project i had to use code examples and concepts from various sources.

I seem to have cloned the project to my computer rather than forking it.
